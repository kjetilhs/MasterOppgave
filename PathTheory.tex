\chapter{Path theory}
A common problem with a vehicle is how to move from A to B, and in what direction should the vehicle be in when at B. 

\section{Straight lines}
A simple solution to a path problem is a straight line between the waypoints. The advantage with straight lines is that the implementation is simple, however a straight line path is only piecewise continuity which is not smooth.
\section{Dubins path}
Dubins path is considered the shortest path between two waypoints. However it's (problem i overgangen mellom sirkel og rett linje)
