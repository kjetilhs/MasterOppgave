\begin{abstract}
\noindent This thesis is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Science degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

The work presented in this thesis has been carried out at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, and would not have been possible without the inputs and contributions from many of its associates. First, I would like to thank Professor Tor Arne Johansen and Professor Thor Inge Fossen for their inspiring ideas and guidance into the academic world. A huge thanks goes to Kristian Klausen for his invaluable help and guidance at the UAV-Lab. Furthermore I want to thank the UAV-pilots Lars Semb and Pål Kvaløy for excellent flying. I would also like to thank my fellow MSc. students at the UAV-Lab. They gave me invaluable feedback and made a coordinated development of the autonomous landing system possible.

Finally I want to thank my parents and brothers for their never-ending support and guidance.
