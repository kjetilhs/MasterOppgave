\section{Navigation system}
The navigation system apply RTKGPS for position and velocity measurement. The output from the RTKGPS software contains only the relative position from the base station, and not the position of the base station. Therefore a task was created to send send the global base station location to the navigation system, which enable the rest of the system to calculate the global position of the uav. 

The base station position is received in the RTKGPS task in DUNE, were it's included in the GpsFixRtk message.

A task in the nest receive the gps position of the base, and the operator can monitor it in neptus. When the operator choose to fix the base station gps position a parameter update is send to the task, which will start to send a gpsfixrtk message to the uav. 

TODO: Create figure that shows the information flow that is used to create the rtkfix message.
\subsection{Operator interface}
The operator use the Neptus platform as operational interface during the landing. The console includes information about the position of the uav, as well as the source of the position measurement. The operator can monitor the status of the gps system, including what is accepted by the navigation system. During a autonmous landing the operator must be fully aware of the status of the navigation system, such that an abort due to lost gps fix. This system can be expanded to include other sensors, like a ranging system, IMU, camera ex.
\subsection{Position correction}%Flytt til resultat
The highly dynaimcal nature of the uav create a challenge for the navigation system due to the blocking of the gps antenna from the satellite constellation. The problem was reduced by using a gps receiver that has a high performance in satellite tracking, however this does not remove the problem. A float solution from the gps system is valid for some seconds after fix is lost, due to the predictive nature of the Extended Kalman filter in rtklib. However after a seartin amount of time the navigation system swithces over to use the position estimate from the pixhawk, which has a lower accuracy level then the rtk gps system. To increase the accuracy level a offset solution is proposed. By calculating the difference between the fixed rtk gps solution and the position solution from the pixhawk a offset can be found. If the offset can be assumed constant or quasi stationary it can be used to increase to accuracy level for the navigation system enough to allow for completion of critical phases of a manoeuvre. However tests showed that the offset was not constant nor quasi stationary. By applying the offset to the pixhawk position solution the accuracy level will increase, but not enough to allow for execution of critical manoeuvres.
In order to make the navigation system more robust, some methods was explored. 
\section{Path generation}
The landing path is separated into three stages; AP, Decent and final approach. The decent path is constructed as a Dubins path, ensuring a smooth and optimal decent toward the final approach. The details for the path is given in the Msc thesis cite(), however a summary will be given.

\section{Evasion}
To ensure the safety of the operator a evasion controller is used to abort the landing when a successful landing is deemed infeasible.

\section{Guidance system}
The guidance system consist of two part. Sliding mode controller, and a los controller

\subsection{Sliding mode controller}
For course control the system use a sliding mode controller that was proposed in the paper \citep{fortuna2015cascaded}, which USGES stability property.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= V_a\cos(\psi) + W_x = V_g\cos(\psi) \\
\dot{y} &= V_a\sin(\psi) + W_y = V_g\sin(\psi) \\
\dot{phi} &= \frac{g}{V_a}\tan(\varphi) \\
\dot{\varphi} &= -\frac{\varphi-\varphi_{cmd}}{T_\varphi} \\
W &= \sqrt{W_x^2 + W_y^2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\epsilon(\varphi) = \begin{cases}

\epsilon', & \text{if}\ 0 \leq \cos(\varphi) < \epsilon' \\
-\epsilon', & \text{if} -\epsilon'<\cos(\varphi) < 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\chi = \tan^{-1}(\frac{\dot{y}}{\dot{x}})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\dot{\chi} = \frac{g\sin(\varphi)(V_a + \cos(\psi)W_x + \sin(\psi)W_y}{\epsilon(\varphi)V_g^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\chi_d &= \tan^{-1}(-\frac{t}{\Delta} \\
\dot{\chi_d} &= -\frac{\Delta}{\Delta^2+y^2}\dot{y} \\
\ddot{\chi} &= \frac{\Delta}{(\Delta^2 + y^2)^2}(2y\dot{y}^2 - (\Delta^2 + y^2)\ddot{y})
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\chi} = \chi - \chi_d

\begin{equation}
s = \dot{\tilde{\chi}} + \lambda\tilde{\chi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
