\chapter{SIL test}
The system was tested through a Software In the Loop (SIL) simulation. In a SIL simulation the same code that runs in the hardware is tested against a simulator which behave similarly to the real system.

\section{Path planing SIL}
The landing path is tested in both guided and FBWA. 
\section{Navigation SIL}
The navigation system was tested by creating a \gls{rtk-gps} simulator. This allowed for testing of the navigation interface, including the fixing of the base station position.

\subsection{Short rtk loss compensator}
The short rtk loss compensator was tested by adding a bias in the position solution from the simulated GpsFixRtk message.
