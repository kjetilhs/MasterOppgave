\chapter{Path planning}
The path planning system must be able to create a flyable landing path from any pose within the uav operation zone. Hence a spacial restriction is placed on the landing path, such that the uavs operation restriction are not broken. In addition the pilot should be able to deside the length of the glide slope, including the height and descent angle.
