\section{Position calculation with range measurement}

Position estimation with the use of range measurement apply the pseudo-range measurement, which is defined as the geometrical range in addition to all errors that has affected the measurement. A pseudo-range model can be:

\begin{equation}
y = h(x) + \beta
\end{equation}

where y is the pseudo-range, $h(x) = ||p_O - p||_2$, and $\beta$ is a stochastic disturbance in the measurement.
