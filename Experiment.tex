\chapter{Experimental field tests}\label{Ch:ExperimentalTesting}
The autonomous landing system has successfully been tested in the field, where the result from two subsequent days is presented. The landing plan was tested and verified at Agdenes airfield with a virtual net placed $26 m$ above ground. The landing plan applied the control system given in appendix \citep{AP:ControlGuidanceSystem} in Fly By Wire A (FBWA) modus, with the navigation system which has been presented in this thesis. The result of the navigation system is presented in section \ref{ss:EXNavigation}.
\section{Landing plan generation system}
The landing plan generation system was test in the field at Agdenes airfield, where the results from two consecutive days are presented. The weather condition differed on those two day, where as the first had windspeeds between $8-9 m/s$ from West while the second day was considered calm. Hence the performance of the autonomous landing system was tested during two different wind condition, where one strained the performance of the system while the other could be considered as ideal conditions. The virtual net was placed above a runway at Agdenes, such that the landing path is similar to a landing path where a physical net is used. All landing plan was generated when the \gls{uav} was in a loiter manoeuvre, such that the plan could be reviewed and the correct controllers assigned to the plan.
\subsection{Day 1}
\subsubsection{First plan}\label{sss:Day1FirstPlan}
The first land plan created during the first day is shown in figure \ref{Fig:NorthEast31mai103029}, which shows the desired path, net position and the actual path of the \gls{uav}. The desired heigh as well as the actual height is shown in figure \ref{Fig:Height31mai103029}. The straight line in the approach path is here chosen to cross the landing path, which lead the \gls{uav} into the crosswind on the straight line between the circles. The effect of flying in the cross wind introduced oscillatory motion in the \gls{uav}, which the lateral control system was unable to remove. The oscillatory behaviour affect the path of the \gls{uav} when entering the final turning circle, where it overshoot the path. The overshot may cause the \gls{uav} to leave the line of sight of the pilot, which is a critical failure in a LOS flight operation. When entering the landing path the \gls{uav} continues to oscillate along the landing path, however the \gls{uav} was able at the time of net passing to have a cross track error within the acceptance criteria.

The longitudinal control system is able to follow it's reference, however the \gls{uav} height starts to diverge from the desired height during the landing path. The divergence corresponds to the overshot in the lateral plan, which could be the reason for the divergence. However the desired height does not reach the height of the net due to a smoothing filer of the desired height in the longitudinal control system. This results in the desired height only to converge to the desired path if the path height remain constant, which is not the case with a net impact angle greater then zero. However with a net impact angle equal to zero, the glide slope will be the sole part of the landing path which is used to decrease the height of the \gls{uav}.

\subsubsection{Path with $\gamma_n = 0$}
A new landing plan, where the desired height and \gls{uav} during the landing plan is shown in figure \ref{Fig:Height31mai31mai105034}, was generated with the net impact angle $\gamma_n = 0$. The effect of setting the net impact angle to zero gave a better performance from the longitudinal control system, due to the desired height now converging to the net center height. At the time the \gls{uav} passed the virtual net the hight error with respect the height of the net center was within the height error acceptance.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Path with inverted rotation direction in the first circle}
An attempt to reduce the oscilatoric motion of the \gls{uav} during the straight line part of the approach path, a new path was created with inverted rotation direction in the first circle, as shown in figure \ref{Fig:NorthEast31mai125420}. The straight line part of the approach path moved the \gls{uav} to fly in the same direction as the wind, which resulted in less oscillatory motion. However the overshoot in the final circle is still present, which is due to a combination of the \gls{uav} turning up against the wind and the lateral controller not being design to follow a turning manoeuvre.

	\caption{North-East plot where the straight line segment between the two circles give a path parallel to the wind}
	\label{Fig:NorthEast31mai125420}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Path with reduced lookahead distance in lateral controller}
In order to further reduce the oscillatory motion in the lateral plan the lookahead distance in the lateral control system was reduced to make the controller more aggressive towards the wind. The effect of this change is shown in figure \ref{Fig:NorthEast31mai131844}, where the oscillatory motion is almost completely removed. However the overshot at end of the final circle shows that the lateral controller is struggling to handle a turning circle.

\caption{North-East plot where the lookahead distance of the lateral controller was reduced to increase performance when flying against the wind}
\label{Fig:NorthEast31mai131844}
\end{figure}
By reviewing the desired roll ($\phi_d$ ) and the actual roll ($\phi$) of the \gls{uav} at the time of the final turn, shown in figure \ref{Fig:DesiredRoll131844}, it's observed that the lateral control system decrease the desired roll in the middle of the turn. This happens since the lateral control system only sees the next point on the circle, and not the circle as a whole.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Summary of day 1}\label{sss:summaryDay1}
The result from the first day was affected with strong wind condition, in which the \gls{uav} struggled to stay on the path and overshooting in the final turning circle. The average heigh and cross track error with respect to desired heigh and path respectfully for 11 landing plan performance, is given in table \ref{tb:Day1HeightCrossTrack}. The average height error vary less then the average cross track error, with a variance of $0.4 m$ against $6.2 m$. However the performance of the \gls{uav} in both height error and cross track error is worse then the results obtain during SIL simulation. This was expected, however the magnitude of the variance in the average cross track error shows that the performance of the lateral control system must increase in order for the autonomous landing system to be considered reliable.

\end{table}
The variance of the longitudinal control system shows that the control system is reliable in performance, however the average error must decrease to allow increased certainty that the \gls{uav} is able to hit the stationary net. In table \ref{tb:Day1LandingAttempt} the results of whether the \gls{uav} passed through the net or not, is present. Most of the alteration on the path and controllers was aimed towards the lateral control system, which is shown be be increased performance during the later attempts. In the comparison to the simulation results, where the average error was almost zero, the performance has clearly decreased. This behaviour was expected due the simulation model used in the simulation has not been verified. In addition the simulation results was obtain after the two experimental test day, where a different time constant was used in the smoothing filter in the longitudinal control system \citep{Sigurd}. It is expected that this alteration would have increased the behaviour of longitudinal control system, however this has not been verified due to limitation in flight days.

\end{table}
The content of table \ref{tb:Day1LandingAttempt} is shown in figure \ref{Fig:Day1NetPass}, where the net is marked as a whole line and all landing attempts are marked as crosses. The oscillatory motion in the lateral plane by the \gls{uav} is reflected in the placement of the crosses. However the placement of the cross shows the effect of a to high average height error by either passing over the net or in the upper part of the net.

\caption{Position of UAV relative to the net center at the time of net passing}
\label{Fig:Day1NetPass}
\end{figure}
During the execution of the landing plan it was discovered that in order for the \gls{uav} to stay above the highest tree tops it had to start its decent from an height of $56 m$ above the airfield. Flying bellow this height would result in the pilot losing sight of the \gls{uav}, which is unacceptable in a LOS \gls{uav} operation. This didn't provide a problem during landing attempt with a virtual net which was placed $26 m$ above the airfield, however during a real stationary net landing it would push the limitation of the operation area in which the \gls{uav} can fly. The flight is a Line Of Sight operation, meaning that the pilot must have the \gls{uav} within sight during the entire flight. A $56 m $ decent with a glide slope angle of $6\deg$ would require a glide slope of $500 m$. An estimate of the the available length of which the \gls{uav} can use to perform a autonomous landing in a stationary net is estimated to be $700 m$. This would require the use of the entire runway at Agdenes. An alternative solution is to attempt to land with a greater glide slope angle, or simply start the landing path from West. Landing attempts from the west has yet to tried, the reason being limited time and that would mean that the \gls{uav} would land in the same direction the wind is typically blowing. This would increase the ground speed of the \gls{uav}, which is undesired. However in the case where the wind is calm enough to be considered negligible, a autonomous landing from west would be a valid option.
\subsection{Day 2}
\subsubsection{First plan}\label{sss:Day2FirstPlan}
The second day had calm wind condition, which is considered as ideal field test conditions for the autonomous landing system. In an attempt to increase the height difference between the start height of the landing path and the net center, a longer glide slope was attempted. The virtual net was place further to the west along the runway, and the length and angle of the glide slope was increase to $280 m$ and $8 \deg$ respectfully. The full path specification for the first path is given in appendix \ref{AP:SpecDay2}. Figure \ref{Fig:NorthEast1juni081328} show a North-East plot of the path created with the new specification, which show that the lateral path overshoots in both the start and finish turning circle. The overshot in the start circle is a result of the roll angle is not able to follow the desired roll angle fast enough, as seen in figure \ref{Fig:Roll1juni081328}, which is due to the low level roll controller being poorly tuned for autonomous flights where high precision performance from the \gls{uav} is desired. In addition the control surface used to control the roll of the \gls{uav} is also used to control the pitch, which results in having to weight the performance in heading against the ability to follow a height reference.

\end{figure}
The desired height and the actual heigh of the \gls{uav} is shown in figure \ref{Fig:Height1juni081328}, which shows that the \gls{uav} is unable to follow a glide slope with a slope angle of $\gamma_l = 8 \deg$. A major reason for this behaviour is due to the failure of the \gls{uav}s low level pitch controller to follow the desired pitch, as shown in figure \ref{Fig:Pitch1juni081328}. The pitch appear to be saturated in the low level controller since it does not attempt to reach the desired pitch. The low level pitch controller must be further fine tuned, and similar to the low level roll controller, has not been fine tuned for autonomous flights where high precision performance is desired.

\subsubsection{Reducing arc segments distance}
In an attempt to further reduce the overshot in the finish turning circle the distance between each arc segments in the approach path circles was reduced from $25 m$ to $10 m$. The desired response with this alteration of the approach path was to ensure that the lateral control system keeps a high desired roll angle through the turning circle, thus reducing the overshot and increase the performance. A North-East plot of the resulting path is shown in figure \ref{Fig:NorthEast1juni083423}, which shows that the \gls{uav} has reduced its overshot in the final turning circle. The desired behaviour where the lateral control system keep a high desired roll angle through is achieved and shown in figure \ref{Fig:RollFinalTurning083423}. The confirmation that the \gls{uav} had a small overshot from the desired path is shown in the cross track error plot given in figure \ref{Fig:CrossTrackError1juni083423}.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Summary day 2}
The second day had ideal weather condition, which allowed for testing of the autonomous landing system in ideal condition. The goal with the second day was to increase the height from which the \gls{uav} would start its decent towards the net by increasing the glide slope angle, and to investigate path parameter that can be used to reduce the \gls{uav}s overshot during turning in the final turning circle. The attempts to increase glide slope angle during the flight test is reflected in table \ref{tb:Day2LandingAttempt}, which contain the results of whether the \gls{uav} passed through the net or not. Attempts with glide slope angle greater then $6 \deg$ resulted in the \gls{uav} to miss the net, however this performance could be increased with a better the use of the same time constant in the smoothing filter in the longitudinal control system and better tuning of the low level pitch controllers. With the current longitudinal control system the maximum glide slope angle that the \gls{uav} is able to follow during a flight is $6 \deg$. In addition increased performance from the longitudinal control system can be achieved by increasing the length of the final approach, in order for the \gls{uav} to have longer time to converge to the net center height. The final approach could be increased to $120 m$ by moving the net further west over. The risk with a large final approach during a autonomous landing in a real net would be the prolonged time the \gls{uav} flies $3-4 m$ above ground. A loss of high accurate positioning system could then result in a crash.

The lateral control system perform better compared to the first day during calm wind condition which is reflected in the table \ref{Tb:AverageCrossHeightDay2}, which contain the performance from 8 landing plan missions. In addition the performance from the longitudinal control system remain similar to the first day. This show that the longitudinal control system is less affected by the wind, however the the average height error of the longitudinal control system must be decreased in order for the autonomous landing to achieve a higher probability of successfully performing a successful net landing. The hight average height error is reflected in figure \ref{Fig:Day2NetPass}, where those crosses that are within the height acceptance criteria are in the upper part of the net.

\subsection{Short loss compensator}
The short loss compensator was engaged during a flight where the \gls{rtk-gnss} started to experience problem. The flight plan was part of cooperative net recovery system presented in \citep{Sigurd} and \citep{Jostein}, which experience reduced \gls{rtk-gnss} performance due to decreased satellite geometry. During the flight the \gls{rtk-gnss} system experienced a drop out, as seen in figure \ref{Fig:NavSource}. The main reason for the drop out is shown in figure \ref{Fig:SatCount1juni114124}, where at the time of \gls{rtk-gnss} drop out the number of valid satellites starts to vary rapidly. Even though the \gls{rtk-gps} position solution is unavailable the navigation system is still able to supply high accurate position solution due to the short \gls{rtk-gnss} compensator as seen in figure \ref{Fig:ShortLoss}.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Summary of navigation system performance}
The navigation system was able to provide high accuracy position solution to the \gls{uav} during the autonomous landing flight plan, however continues drop out of the \gls{rtk-gnss} system was experienced when the satellite geometry decreased, which make the positioning system more susceptible to atmospheric disturbance. The continues drop out could be reduced by increasing the elevation mask in RTKlib, however this would limit the valid satellites to a number where a FIX solution from the \gls{rtk-gnss} system is no longer available. In order for the system to be able to perform during a prolong duration of degraded satellite geometry a state estimator must be created which can give a accurate position estimate with minimum \gls{rtk-gnss} information available. This would be a more advance estimator then the short loss compensator presented in this thesis.

The short loss compensator was able to compensate the solution from the external navigation system, such that a large jump in \gls{uav} position was avoided for a short time. However the limits of the short loss compensator has yet to determined, and should be further tested. The goal of the navigation system is be to be able to provide high accurate position solution to the \gls{uav}, even if the \gls{rtk-gnss} system experience a drop out.
\section{Summary}
This chapter has presented the results of a X8 fixed wing \gls{uav} performing autonomous landing in a virtual net, in addition to the performance of the navigation system. The two days where the autonomous landing system was tested had different weather condition, which allowed for identification of strength and weaknesses with the system. The longitudinal control system had a stable performing, however a large average error in the height with respect to the desired height shows a performance that is not acceptable for a autonomous landing system. Compeering to the results obtain in the SIL experiment \ref{SIL:Results} where the low level controllers are fined tuned, it's observed that the performance can increase with better tuning of the low level pitch controller. Better performance from the low level pitch controller can allow for increase in the glide slope angle, which would result in a shorter glide slope and increase operational control over the \gls{uav}. 
The lateral control system function completely different depending on the wind condition. The lateral controller require different tuning parameter depending on the wind speed and in which direction is affecting the \gls{uav}. When flying against the wind a short lookahead distance is needed in order for the lateral control system is stay on the desired path, however when flying with the wind the lookahead distance should increase in order for the \gls{uav} to stay on the desired path. A possible solution to this problem would be to implement the the lookahead distance as a function of the cross track error, which in \citep{fossen2011handbook} section 10.3.2 is given as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta(t) = \sqrt{R^2 - e(t)^2}

where $\Delta(t)$ is the lookahead distance, $R$ is the maximum lookahead distance and $e(t)$ is the cross track error. The lateral control system was unable to completely follow the path along the turning circles without overshooting. A solution which would solve this problem would be a lateral control system design for turning manoeuvres. The problem with this approach would be that a landing path would require two set of lateral control system, which would result in a over complicated system. The best approach would be to improve the current lateral control system to better perform turning manoeuvre, which together with the proposed solution for the lookahead distance would result in a robust lateral control system.

The landing plan has proven that it's flexible when it comes to path alteration. The path can be constructed to suit the needs of the operator, and can be use to increase the performance from the control system. In order for the longitudinal control system to reach a desired height which corresponds to the net center height, the net impact angle must be set to zero. Unfortunately this means that the glide slope will be the only part of the landing path where the height is decreased, however from a control perspective this means that the \gls{uav} have longer time to converge to the correct height. In the turning circles the distance between each arc segment can be adjusted in order to achieve better performance from the lateral control system. However for this to have an affect the time of arrival factor must be kept between $1-2$ seconds, in order to prevent the path control system from switching point to early. A arc segment distance of $10 m$ was found to ensure that the lateral control system kept a high roll angle through the turning circle.

The minimum height from which the autonomous landing system could start the landing path from was found to be $56 m$ above the runway at Agdenes airfield. This strain the operation boundaries in which the \gls{uav} operates, since a landing path could move the \gls{uav} out of the line of sight of the pilot. An autonomous landing from the east is possible with the current system, however further testing is needed in order to determine the operation weather limitations of the system. In addition a landing attempt from the west could be performed with a lower start height, which then would require less usage of the runway.

The navigation system performed with satisfying results, and showed that it's able to provide a stable and reliable \gls{rtk-gnss} solution to the navigation system. However the \gls{rtk-gnss} is still prone to bad satellite geometry, which will result in the \gls{rtk-gnss} system to loose lock of the satellites. During these events the short \gls{rtk-gnss} loss compensator is able to compensate the external navigation system, such that the navigation position solution remain at the same accuracy level as with \gls{rtk-gnss}. The time limitation in which the compensator is able to operate without divergence from the \gls{rtk-gnss} accuracy level has yet to determined,  however an estimate would be that the current limitation could be doubled.
